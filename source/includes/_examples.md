We've published <a href="https://github.com/planet-os/notebooks" target="_blank">a collection of Jupyter notebooks on GitHub</a> that provide API use case examples in Python. The notebooks are well-annotated so you can learn as you step through the commands.

The repository includes details on how to install Jupyter and the required Python modules, as well as tips to get you started.
